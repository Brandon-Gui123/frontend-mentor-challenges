## My process

I first listed down what I needed to do to get my own QR code component looking like the shown design.

Next, I created the structure of the QR code component in HTML. It seems like the QR code component is made up of 3 components: the QR code, a title and a description. These 3 components can be represented with HTML tags so I quickly typed them out.

Thirdly, I focused to style the obvious portions of the QR code component, such as text alignment. Once I finished with the positioning and alignment of the component, I'll then focus on font families and colour.

Fourthly, I start to focus on the minor details, like the box shadow, font family and colour. With the alignment already taken care of earlier, I wouldn't have to worry about my styles possibly altering the alignment and position of the card.

Lastly, I add a footer to put in credits.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic elements in HTML5
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I learned

Upon reading the comments for my solution on the [NFT Preview Card Component challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/nft-preview-card-component-LW4HNpC2O), I noticed that there were several comments suggesting me to use the `main` tag, which kinda reminded me that semantic elements exists and they do, for a reason.

This is why I try to use them where I needed them in my HTML.

Back probably one or two months ago, I came across [a YouTube video](https://youtu.be/mr15Xzb1Ook) that briefly introduced Tailwind CSS.

This was vastly different from how I typically write CSS so I decided to give it a try here when I had the time.

### Continued development

Probably try and implement animations?

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - mainly for when I don't know what is the utility class for a certain CSS property

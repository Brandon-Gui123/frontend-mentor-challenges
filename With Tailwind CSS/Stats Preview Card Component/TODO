Design considerations for desktop:
    - Image should not appear stretched or squished (i.e. aspect ratio maintained at all times)
        - If height of card changes, change the width of the image (and the card) to maintain aspect ratio
        - If width of card changes w/o height changes, do not change the width of the image (allow left side of card to expand but fix the right side)

Stuff to do:
    [ ] Create HTML structure for the stats preview card component
    * Figure out how to design the card as per the design considerations:
        [ ] Which CSS properties do we need to implement? And on who?
    * Statistics styling:
        
    * Misc:
    [ ] Style text size
    [ ] Style text colour
